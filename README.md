### **Problem Statement**
Heavy vehicles are widely used in industry to transport goods because they are economical and flexible. 
So as it is one of the primary types of vehicle for the transportation of goods, it costs a lot of money in case of a vehicle breakdown. 
A well-maintained vehicle is one of the keys to saving money and time.


One of the components that are critical to heavy vehicles is Air Pressure System (APS). 
It generates pressurized air with the help of an air compressor driven by the engine to be used for various components such as braking, gear changing, etc.
